# React Form Shield Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams that illustrate the architecture and data flow of React Form Shield.

## Available Diagrams

- [Client-Side Architecture](./client-side-architecture.md): Illustrates the architecture of React Form Shield's client-side components
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md): Illustrates the data flow between the user, form, FormShield, and server

## Using the Diagrams

These diagrams are created using [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/), a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool. They can be rendered in any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid syntax, including GitHub and many Markdown editors.

## Future Diagrams

In future releases, we plan to add the following diagrams:

- **Server-Side Architecture**: Illustrates the architecture of React Form Shield's server-side components
- **Challenge Flow**: Illustrates the flow of the challenge dialog
- **Integration Diagrams**: Illustrates how React Form Shield integrates with different form libraries
